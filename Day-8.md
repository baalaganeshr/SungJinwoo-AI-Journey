# Remove Element

**Problem:** Remove all instances of a specific value from an array in-place.

**Date:** June 4, 2025 | **Day:** -8

## The Problem

Given array `nums` and value `val`, remove all occurrences of `val`. Return count of remaining elements.

**Example:**
```
Input:  nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: nums = [2,2,_,_], return 2
```

## Solution

**Idea:** Use one pointer to track where to place non-target elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        k = 0  # Position for next good element
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
        
        return k
```

## How It Works

1. **k pointer** = where to put next good element
2. **Check each element** = if not equal to val, keep it
3. **Move good elements forward** = copy to position k
4. **Count survivors** = k is the final count

## Step by Step

```
nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

i=0: nums[0]=3, equals val ‚Üí skip
     [3,2,2,3], k=0

i=1: nums[1]=2, not val ‚Üí keep
     [2,2,2,3], k=1

i=2: nums[2]=2, not val ‚Üí keep  
     [2,2,2,3], k=2

i=3: nums[3]=3, equals val ‚Üí skip
     [2,2,2,3], k=2

Result: First 2 elements [2,2], return 2
```

## Test It

```python
def test():
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test 1
    nums1 = [3,2,2,3]
    k1 = solution.removeElement(nums1, 3)
    print(f"Result: {nums1[:k1]}, k={k1}")  # [2,2], k=2
    
    # Test 2  
    nums2 = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]
    k2 = solution.removeElement(nums2, 2)
    print(f"Result: {nums2[:k2]}, k={k2}")  # [0,1,3,0,4], k=5

test()
```

## Key Points

‚úÖ **Modifies array in-place**  
‚úÖ **Order may change (that's okay)**  
‚úÖ **Only first k elements matter**  
‚úÖ **Single pass through array**

## Time & Space

- **Time:** O(n) - Check each element once
- **Space:** O(1) - Only use one extra pointer

**Simple and direct.** üéØ
