🛡️ Good News! You're All Set for Tomorrow
You DON'T need to create new tokens or API keys tomorrow! Everything is already configured and ready to go.

✅ What's Already Saved & Ready
🔹 Azure OpenAI Service ✅
Resource: baala-mbtc7zdf-eastus2

Model: gpt-4o-mini (deployed and working)

Status: Stays active – no expiration

🔹 API Key ✅
Already saved in:
ai-agents-learning/02-explore-agentic-frameworks/code_samples/.env

No expiration – will work tomorrow

🔹 Environment Setup ✅
All packages installed

Configuration files ready

Persistent setup – no need to reinstall anything

🔄 Tomorrow You Just Need To:
Open VS Code

Navigate to your project:
ai-agents-learning

Open any notebook (Chapter 2 or 3)

Run the cells – everything should work immediately! ⚡

💡 What's Persistent vs. What's Not:
✅ PERSISTENT (Saved):
Azure OpenAI resource & API keys

Your .env file at:
ai-agents-learning/02-explore-agentic-frameworks/code_samples/.env

Installed Python packages

All your code and notebooks

🔄 TEMPORARY (Needs Restart):
Python kernel

Any running processes (just re-run cells – completely normal)

🚀 Quick Start for Tomorrow:
Sleep well! Your AI agents will be waiting for you tomorrow! 🤖✨
No new setup needed – just pick up where you left off!
