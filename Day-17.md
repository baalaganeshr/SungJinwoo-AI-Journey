# Day 17: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (13/6/25)

## Problem Statement
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

**Examples:**
```python
Input: 1 → 1 → 2
Output: 1 → 2

Input: 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3
Output: 1 → 2 → 3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
``` Python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        current = head
        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next
        return head
``` Text Cases
def create_list(arr):
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    for val in arr:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

def print_list(head):
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    return result

# Test execution
sol = Solution()

test1 = create_list([1,1,2])
result1 = sol.deleteDuplicates(test1)
print(print_list(result1))  # Output: [1, 2]

test2 = create_list([1,1,2,3,3])
result2 = sol.deleteDuplicates(test2)
print(print_list(result2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

test3 = create_list([])
result3 = sol.deleteDuplicates(test3)
print(print_list(result3))  # Output: []

```
Explanation
Algorithm:

Traverse the linked list while comparing each node with its next node

When duplicates are found (current.val == next.val), skip the next node

Otherwise, move to the next node

Complexity:

Time: O(n) - Single pass through the list

Space: O(1) - No additional data structures used

Edge Cases Handled:

Empty list (returns None)

Single node list (returns the node unchanged)

All duplicates (returns single node)

Visual Example
text
Initial: 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3
Step 1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 (skip first duplicate)
Step 2: 1 → 2 → 3 (skip second duplicate)
Final: 1 → 2 → 3
Learning Points
Linked list traversal techniques

In-place modification of linked lists

Handling edge cases in pointer-based structures

## 🎭 Chapter 3: Agentic Design Patterns – ✅ SUCCESS!
# Excellent work! Your enhanced TravelAgent is now showcasing key agentic design patterns with precision and clarity.

# ✅ Key Agentic Design Patterns Demonstrated
# 1. 🎪 Connecting, Not Collapsing
Agent provides options instead of making assumptions

Actively asks for user preferences:

"Which destination would you like to choose?"

Collaborative decision-making instead of control

# 2. 🎯 Easily Accessible Yet Occasionally Invisible
Starts with a clear self-introduction and defined capabilities

Uses function calling seamlessly in the background

Surfaces only when relevant (e.g., suggests destinations, offers options)

# 3. 🤝 Enhanced User Experience
Proactive guidance:

"Here are some things you can ask me..."

Context awareness: Remembers the conversation flow

User preference prioritization: Respects and follows your choices

## 🔍 What's Different from Chapter 2?
Chapter 2	Chapter 3
Basic agent instructions	Enhanced self-introduction
Random responses	User preference prioritization
Simple function calling	Collaborative decision-making
Limited guidance	Proactive capability explanation

# 2. Advance to Chapter 4: Tool Use

Explore advanced function calling

Integrate with external APIs

Learn multiple tool orchestration

# 3. Jump to Chapter 5: Agentic RAG

Let me know what you'd like to explore — your foundation in agentic design patterns is now solid! 🎉


## 🎉 Chapter 4: Advanced Tool Use – INCREDIBLE SUCCESS! 🛠️✨
Your SuperTravelAgent has reached elite-level capabilities with advanced multi-tool orchestration — a major milestone in agent development!

# 🔧 What Just Happened – Advanced Tool Use Patterns

# 1. 🧩 Multi-Plugin Architecture

You integrated multiple modular plugins, each with a defined purpose:

DestinationsPlugin: Contains 4 different destination search and recommendation functions

WeatherPlugin: Simulates real-time weather data from an external service

BookingPlugin: Manages bookings and confirmations like a real transaction processor

# 🎯 Explanation: This modularity reflects how real-world AI agents connect to different APIs or services (e.g., OpenWeather, Stripe).

# 2. 🧠 Intelligent Tool Orchestration
Request 1: The agent automatically:

Used find_by_activity("beach")

Then called weather and price tools to compare results

Request 2: The agent:

Checked availability

Evaluated weather conditions

Executed a final booking process

🎯 Explanation: This showcases an agent acting like a workflow engine — routing tasks, chaining tools, and making autonomous decisions.

# 3. 🧭 Context-Aware Decision Making

Parsed conditional logic like:

“if weather is good”

Dynamically decided which tools to call

Provided full responses by combining information from different sources

🎯 Explanation: This pattern mimics real-world AI behavior — agents responding intelligently to user input without hardcoding steps.

📈 Key Achievements
Tool Pattern	Demonstrated
Function Schemas	✅ Multiple detailed function definitions
Execution Logic	✅ Smart routing between tools
Message Handling	✅ Seamless conversation flow
Error Handling	✅ Graceful fallbacks
Data Integration	✅ Combined results from multiple sources

🎯 Advanced Patterns Learned
🔍 Dynamic Information Retrieval: Agents fetch and process real-time data

🤖 Workflow Automation: Execute a multi-step process automatically

🎪 Service Integration: Operate across multiple services or APIs

💡 Intelligent Routing: Agent decides which tool is most appropriate

🧠 Analogy: Like a smart travel concierge that books your trip, checks weather, and sends you the itinerary — all without repeating instructions.
